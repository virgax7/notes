Map intellij build project to Ctrl 6 and then rebuild it to have Devtools take effect.

I am guessing you are coding and expect DevTools to auto-magically 
figure out you have changed something in your project? Devtools does that
by watching your classpath folder(s). When a .class file (or a resource)
has changed, devtools take the appopriate action.


tldr, update the classpath
