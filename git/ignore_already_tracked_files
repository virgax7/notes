so you added things to .gitignore that are already being tracked...

go ahead and commit that .gitignore file

then do this from the project root dir

git rm -r --cached . 

-- the things in the git index(cached) will be removed
-- this doesn't rm your changes

git add .

-- this will re add things that are not being ignored in the .gitignore
